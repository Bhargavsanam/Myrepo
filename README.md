# Simple Interest Calculator

This repository contains a Python script (`simple_interest.py`) that calculates simple interest.

## Description

The `simple_interest.py` script takes three inputs from the user:

*   **Principal (P):** The initial amount of money.
*   **Rate (R):** The annual interest rate (as a percentage).
*   **Time (T):** The time period for which the interest is calculated (in years).

The script then calculates the simple interest (SI) using the formula: SI = (P * R * T) / 100

Finally, it prints the calculated simple interest to the console.

## How to Run

1.  Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepositoryname.git` (replace with your repository URL)
3.  Navigate to the repository directory: `cd yourrepositoryname`
4.  Run the script: `python simple_interest.py`
5.  The script will prompt you to enter the principal, rate, and time.
